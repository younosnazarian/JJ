<p>JNCIE-SEC (#314) is my latest achievement. I have ten years plus experience working with Juniper Networks products and 3000+ hours of instructing and training experience. Fluency in English, eternal love for teaching, familiarity with different cultures, analytical and creative thinking, enthusiasm about technology, and real-world carrier/enterprise class experience paved the way for me to become a well-recognized and trusted Juniper expert, consultant, and trainer. I am privileged to work with the most prominent carriers/enterprises and train hundreds of people.</p>
